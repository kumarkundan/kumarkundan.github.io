            I have over 8 years of experience as a software engineer and have worked at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise includes developing and designing Responsive Mobile-First Web Applications and Hybrid Mobile Applications along with building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms) using the best available technology stack.

           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilities, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
